# Skosh

Skosh is a command-line shell following traditions of Unix systems.

Skosh is derived from public domain ksh (pdksh) to provide an up-to-date public
domain Unix shell implementation.

Skosh will support the POSIX Shell command language and the most of the
KornShell programming language (1993).
In addition to the POSIX and KornShell modes, we will implement a modern
language suitable for both interactive and non-interactive use cases.
