# Skosh

Skosh is a reliable and efficient Unix command-line shell derived from pdksh.

Skosh supports the POSIX.2-1993 Shell Command Language as well as the most of
the KornShell language as defined in *The New KornShell Command and Programming
Language* by Morris Bolsky and David Korn. We will implement newer standards
and other extensions to Skosh in the future.
