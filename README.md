# Skosh

Skosh is a command-line shell following traditions of Unix systems.
It is derived from public domain ksh (pdksh) to provide an up-to-date public
domain Unix shell implementation.

Skosh will support the POSIX shell command language and the most of the
KornShell language as defined in *The New KornShell Command and Programming
Language* by Morris Bolsky and David Korn.
In addition to the POSIX and KornShell modes, we will implement a modern
language suitable for both interactive and non-interactive use cases.

## Status

Skosh is in pre-alpha stage. Stay tuned.
